The target of the Website are Women

The layout of a website that in nowadays that people most use mobile devices to access internet and I ask Claudia about it and she said yes, whenever creating a websites always think about mobile layout of how people see it on their small devices and then desktop. And so this are  Wordpress layout, some are free and  some are premium:  wordpresslayout

The music in front of a page is not a good idea, I asked Claudia if its a good idea to play a music when open the website and she said no. Because its annoying to most of people and also disability women who canâ€™t listen to the screen reader because of a music playing in the background. So we want to attract most women we can by doing the colors that women liked and situation to attract women.
